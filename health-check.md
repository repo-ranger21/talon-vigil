# Health Check Endpoint Verification

## TalonVigil Health Check
The current implementation provides a health check at:
```
GET /api/health
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "service": "TalonVigil API",
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-16T19:06:50.112412",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Flask Example (Alternative Implementation)
@app.route('/health')
def health():
    return {'status': 'ok'}, 200

## FastAPI Example
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}

## Testing the Health Endpoint
```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# For Replit deployments
curl https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/api/health
```

## Civic Disclaimers
- Health checks do not expose sensitive data.
- Endpoints are for operational parity and uptime checks only.
- The `/api/health` endpoint provides service status for monitoring systems.
