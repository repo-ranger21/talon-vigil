   ```

## Running the Application

### Local Development Mode

1. **Start Redis server**
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

2. **Start Celery worker** (in a separate terminal)
   ```bash
   celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
   ```

3. **Start Celery Beat scheduler** (in a separate terminal, if using scheduled tasks)
   ```bash
   celery -A app.celery beat --loglevel=info
   ```

4. **Run the Flask application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   Or use the development script:
   ```bash
   ./run_dev.sh
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Documentation

The application provides RESTful APIs for:
- User authentication and management
- Tenant operations
- Threat intelligence data
- System monitoring and health checks

API endpoints are documented and accessible at `/api/` when the application is running.

## Security Considerations

- All passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's secure hashing
- CSRF protection is enabled for all forms
- Rate limiting prevents abuse of authentication endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- Secure session management
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive data
